      <h2>Learn to Build Compilers</h2>
    </header>

    <p>We are building a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> compiler for a project
      we initiated 2 years ago
      called <a href="/thengascript/">Thengascript</a>, a way to
      program web applications in Malayalam, our mother tongue. Towards this purpose, we began looking for resources to
      help us understand the <strong>craft of compiler engineering</strong>. This lead us to a research where we came across some stellar resources and great people working in the domain. Here we present the result of our searches as a
      a round-up of the great stuff we gathered.</p>

    <p>Compilers are curious creatures. They take in a language,
      <strong>roughly comprehensible by humans</strong>, as its input and turns it into a
      form <strong>comprehensible by machines</strong>. This translation can happen in
      a single step or a series of steps, each of which can produce an intermediate
      language with a certain set of good properties. After this
      transformation is done, something magical happens: it makes <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> possible.</p>

    <p>If peeking under their hood to understand how things work spark joy when you
    find out, compiler construction could be right up your alley. This curation
    done under the light of our own exploration of literature and media
    on compilers. We curate the easily accessible ones that form a
    rough progression as a roadmap and then list general resources that will help you once you have a grounding in the basics. We have 
    tried to give credit to the people who have made this as they
    are the real heroes who have dedicated their time and effort to lend their broad shoulders to enable us to build
    novel things.</p>

    <p>We have catalogued these resources in a way to help a beginner interested in making
    compilers, to proceed <strong>step by step</strong>, to become an expert. If you
    think we have left out any great resources,
    please <a href="https://twitter.com/makersofkerala">reach out to us.</a></p>


	<header><h2>Roadmap for Beginners</h2></header>


<p>First of all, we present a roadmap we have used to understand
      compilers. The selection here is chosen in a way
      it <strong>unfolds their complexity, a few steps at a time</strong>.</p>

<div id="roadmap"></div>

<div class="share-section">
  <p>If you liked this roadmap, share it with your friends who would be interested in it. Share via:</p>
  <div>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://makers-of-kerala.com/compilers.html&text=Learn%20to%20Build%20Compilers!&via=makersofkerala">Twitter</a>
  <a href="https://wa.me/?text=Learn%20to%20Build%20Compilers!%20https://makers-of-kerala.com/compilers.html">Whatsapp</a>

  <a href="tg://msg_url?url=https://makers-of-kerala.com/compilers.html&text=Learn%20to%20Build%20Compilers!">Telegram</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now if you have completed that roadmap, and you are still
  interested in learning more about compilers, you are quite likely <strong>someone
  who is passionate about engineering complex artifacts</strong>. Then a <strong>deep dive into compilers</strong> could be the right thing for
  you next.</p>
<p>We have collected here some <strong>high quality resources</strong> that unravel the engineering
  techniques used for building compilers. Few key things are
  required to see them through completion: the <strong>headspace to work
  through these in long stretches of time and the discipline to see
  the courses through to their end</strong>. By engaging in this meticulous process and making programming languages could
  just be one of the most fulfilling undertakings you do as an engineer.</p>

Topics covered include: lexical analysis; parsing theory; symbol tables; type systems; scope; semantic analysis; intermediate representations; runtime environments; code generation; and basic program analysis and optimization. Students will construct a compiler for a simple object-oriented language during the course's programming projects.",

description: "Introduction to what programmers need to know about programming languages and their implementations. You will design and implement small languages, called domain-specific languages (DSLs), which are the glue of the complex software that we write today. You will also learn about principles and implementation of large, general-purpose languages and about how to exploit modern features of these languages. As the final project, you will get to design and implement a small language of your choice, from start to finish.",
