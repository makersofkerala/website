      <h2>Reviewing the Original Bitcoin Paper: A First Pass</h2>
      <h3>30 April 2020</h3>
      </header>
      <p>We are taking a 3 pass approach as outlined in
      <a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf">Keshav's Paper</a></p>
      <p>With this approach, you go through paper in three gradual
      passes, each unfolding the complexity of the paper
      progressively. Keeping it in separate passes allows you to
      assess the content in different resolutions: form a
      gestalt and then progressively refine in on the details.</p>

      <p>Using this approach, we filtered Satoshi Nakomoto's original
	paper and we produce our assessment here. It is accompanied
	with answers to the five questions that the first pass is
	required to produce.</p>

<p>Even on a preliminary read it is clear that the author has
  concentrated not on the correctness part of engineering or to show
  a theoretical proof, but was fully oriented towards creating
  a foundation for a <strong>practical running system</strong>. The <strong>most interesting
  part</strong> in the paper&rsquo;s abstract highlights the need for creating
  a body of work that acts as a <strong>long term source of truth</strong>. The place
  where the largest amount of work has been put forth surely seems
  like a clever engineering technique at the user experience level. The <strong>leverage of human factors for engineering the system</strong> can be
  sensed when he lays down observations like the possibility of
  largest CPU power or the nodes in charge doesn't actively go against
  the system, as in an auto immune disease. It is clear that the author has looked at this
  idea from <strong>multiple perspectives</strong> and has come up with a somewhat
  holistic approach to creating a digital currency. It is a commendable effort put forth from the author in this respect.</p>


<ul id="qa">
  <li><span><strong>Category</strong>: What type of paper is this?</span>
    <p>P2P Electronic Cash. Bitcoin unlocked a lot of novel areas in the
    digital finance space.</p></li>

  <li><strong>Context</strong>: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases
	were used to analyze the problem?
    <p>The theoretical basis used to construct it largely seems to be
    cryptographical papers, P2P networks and economics. It would need
    a few more passes to unearth the related papers.</p></li>

  <li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

    <p>Don't have enough mettle in this area to verify if it is correct.</p></li>

  <li><strong>Contributions</strong>: What are the paperâ€™s main contributions?</span>
    <p>It has created it's own intellectual tradition and quite a few
    cryptocoins and exchanges all around the world.</p></li>


<li><span><strong>Clarity</strong>: Is the paper well written?</span>
    <p>Looks like the paper is a short and straight forward read.</p></li>

</ul>
